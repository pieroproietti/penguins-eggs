# Way to Fedora
We start from the `Fedora-Server-netinst-x86_64-40-1.14.iso` image, which is 765M, and go to install Fedora server choosing minumun installation, set root password and user. 

I initially just chosen the disk, it was formatted as xfs, I want a simple schema with swap and / formatted ext4, there is no way seem.

OK, I found the way to text installation, just edit the cmdline and put `inst.text`. 

Nothing to do - and this is quite ugly: CLI installation don't give full control on partitions. Tried with `Rocky-9.4-x86_64-minimal.iso` the same... 

I'm short signer, will retry in the mornig seem me to see better!

I tried and was successfull same day after, it was diffult to find a way to install it minimun and ext4.

On the installed select "minimun installation", the button to confirm is up left or down right. 

On Disk, selecte a disk I used a 32G disk, choose the third option, create a bios  boot partition (just 1M), then an ext4 partition. 

Messages are unreadable, really a bad for a short signed persona like me, but we passed.

We can create root password and our `artisan` user.

Installation is graphical and don't need to describe.

> [!NOTE]
> This is tested just on BIOS, under a VM on Proxmox VE.

## reboot
The best is, after reboot, to connect via ssh to can copy and past the command. Then:

```
dnf install \
    lightdm-gtk-greeter \
    spice-vdagent \
    xfce4-settings \
    xfce4-screensaver \
    xfce4-terminal \
    xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin \
    spice-vdagent

systemctl set-default graphical.target 
systemctl enable lightdm
systemctl enable spice-vdagentd

```

## others
```
dnf install \
    bash-completion \
    firefox \
    git \
    lsb-release \
    rsync \
    xdg-user-dirs \
    xrandr 

```

### nodejs, npm e pnpm
```
dnf install nodejs pnpm

```


## customize colibri from wardrobe
We just copy customization from penguins-wardrobe, on the folder `dirs` under `penguins-wardrobe/costumes/colibri/` on `/`, then copy `/etc/skel` on the home of current user.

```
sudo rsync -avx  penguins-wardrobe/costumes/colibri/dirs/ /
rm -rf ${HOME}/.[^.]* ${HOME}/.??*
cp /etc/skel/.* "${HOME}/." -R

```

## eggs development tools

### Visual studio code
```
git  clone https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-wardrobesudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
echo -e "[code]\nname=Visual Studio Code\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc" | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/vscode.repo > /dev/null

```
Then: 
```
dnf check-update
sudo dnf install code
```

## dependencies penguins-eggs on Fedora
This are that we need, almost complete... 

```
sudo dnf install \
    cryptsetup \
    curl \
    dosfstools \
    fuse \
    git \
    jq \
    lsb-release \
    lvm2 \
    dracut \
    nodejs \
    overlayfs-tools \
    parted \
    pnpm \
    rsync \
    syslinux \
    squashfs-tools \
    sshfs \
    xorriso

```

# Clone penguins-eggs
```
git clone https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs
cd penguins-eggs
pnpm i
pnpm build

```

Now we can use eggs from the source:

## Autocomplete, Desktop icons
We want to work with all the conveniences of eggs installed, especially completing commands with TAB, links, etc:
```
./install-eggs-dev
```

## Create a link to ${HOME}/penguins-eggs/eggs
It is tedious to always put ./eggs to start eggs from source, we can create a symbolic link to avoid the hassle:
```
sudo ln -s ${HOME}/penguins-eggs/eggs /usr/bin/eggs`
```

## Create a link to ${HOME}/penguins-eggs/eggs
It is tedious to always put ./eggs to start eggs from source, we can create a symbolic link to avoid the hassle:
```
sudo ln -s ${HOME}/penguins-eggs/eggs /usr/bin/eggs`
```

## Configuration eggs

```
sudo ./eggs dad -d
./eggs status
sudo ./eggs produce --pendrive

```

The result at the moment is a not bootable ISO. 
During `sudo eggs produce` I'm getting this error:
```
eggs >>> error on command: chroot /home/eggs/.mnt/filesystem.squashfs echo live:evolution | chroot /home/eggs/.mnt/filesystem.squashfs chpasswd, code: 127
eggs >>> error on command: chroot /home/eggs/.mnt/filesystem.squashfs echo root:evolution | chroot /home/eggs/.mnt/filesystem.squashfs chpasswd, code: 127
```

We get a `filesystem.squasfs` of 1.3 G and an ISO file 1.5 G.

The ISO is not bootable, must to check why, and there is to check dependencies too.

I have an annoying problem with `spice-vdagent`, work just the first time I install it, later not. 

Of course, before to produce a real ISO we must prepare an `initramfs` capable to load `filesystem.squashfs` and chroot on it.

# Actual state 

After the experience with AlpineLinux, I realized that I must to work on the main branch and check Debian, Arch and Alpine not became broken.

I was able to create a `filesystem.squashfs` that should work and an ISO file booting on BIOS systems. We are about at the same point of Alpine, so we need again:
- create an `initramfs` file, to loads and mount as new_root `/live/filesystem.squashfs`;
- fix boot on UEFI for live image, fix something in BIOS too.

# Fedora peoples, someone can help? 
This is my end for now... but in same way can be an usefull starting point to someone more expert than me on Fedora, please help.
