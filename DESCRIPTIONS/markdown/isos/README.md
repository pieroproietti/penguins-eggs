# Penguins' eggs remastered ISOs

All ISOs are remastered from penguins-eggs, on [google-drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19fwjvsZiW0Dspu2Iq-fQN0J-PDbKBlYY) you can find both: naked and GUI versions, on [penguins-eggs.net](https://penguins-eggs.net/downloads) you will find just naked version - I don't have enought spaces - finally you can find them on [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/files/).

To install the system you have 3 ways:

* GUI installer calamares
* TUI installer krill: `sudo eggs install`
* TUI installer krill: `sudo eggs install --unattended`

## user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

All the ISOs include eggs >= 9.3.x

# Installing ISOS via PXE

One feature of ISO images made with eggs is the ability to be used for network installation . All you have to do is boot the ISO to be installed, open a terminal window and type the command: 

```sudo eggs cuckoo```.

Then all you have to do is boot from the network the machines to be installed and start the calamares or krill installer.

You can also perform an unattended installation with krill, see the [manual](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/english) or, find assistance in the [telegram Penguins' eggs](https://t.me/penguins_eggs) group.

# More informations
There is a [Penguins' eggs official guide](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/eggs-users-guide) and same other documentation - mostly for [DOCUMENTATION](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs/tree/master/DOCUMENTATION). I want to point out [hens, differents species](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION/hens-different-species.md) a brief how to use eggs in Debian. Arch and Manjaro, and the post [Arch-naked](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/archlinux-naked.html) on the blog which describes how to create an Arch naked live, install it, then dress the resulting system with a graphics development station.
