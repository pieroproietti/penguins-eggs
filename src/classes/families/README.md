This classes, abstract same functions used with eggs to install/remove/check packages, then the resulting methods are used on eggs.

## History
I started with Debian but always with the idea to expand eggs to others distros, come a long time before to really trying: just eggs was not mature enought and too difficult to have all together.

So, after the first time of eggs, when I wrote just mockup for fedora ans SuSE, the first reall addiction was manjaro, then archlinux.

## Plan
I'm commenting and I will refactoring a bit this sources directory, with the hope someone want to assist and try to expand eggs for others distros:
* fedora
* funtoo
* gentoo
* opensuse
* void linux
