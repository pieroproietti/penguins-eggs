# Gemini Project Context: penguins-eggs

## Project Overview

`penguins-eggs` is a command-line tool for remastering AlmaLinux, AlpineLinux, Arch, Debian, Devuan, Fedora, Manjaro, Openmamba, openSuSE, RockyLinux, Ubuntu and derivative systems. It allows users to create a live, bootable ISO image of their current system, with optional LUKS encryption, which can be used for backups, distribution, or creating custom operating system versions. The project is written in TypeScript and built using the oclif framework for CLIs.

Can use two different system installer:
- **krill**: `sudo eggs install` is a TUI system installer, always included and operational
- **calamares**: calamares is the GUI system installer used by eggs.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Framework:** [oclif](https://oclif.io/) (for building the CLI)
- **Package Manager:** npm (or pnpm, based on `pnpm-lock.yaml`)
- **Testing:** Mocha (test runner), Chai (assertion library)
- **Linting:** ESLint
- **Formatting:** Prettier

## Development Key Commands

- **Installation:** `npm install` or `pnpm install`
- **Build:** `npm run build` (compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in `dist/`)
- **Run Tests:** `npm test`
- **Lint Code:** `npm run lint`
- **Run the CLI locally:** `./bin/run [COMMAND]` (e.g., `./bin/run eggs --help`)

## User Key Commands
- **eggs love** get your ISO in one command (run: eggs krll, eggs dad -d, eggs, tools clean and produce)
- **eggs kill** remove old createed ISOs
- **eggs dad** configure eggs
