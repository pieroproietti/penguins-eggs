# Short Summary
On the road of Remastersys, SystemBack and father Knoppix!

# Full Description
Penguins' eggs is a terminal utility, in active development, which allows you to remaster your system and redistribute it as an ISO image.

# Installation
Download the package according your architecture, **sudo apt install eggs_7.8.41-amd64.deb** and **sudo apt install -f**.

# Configure and create your first iso image
sudo eggs dad

# Easy to learn, easy to to update
**man eggs** on cli system, **eggs mom** with gui. eggs don't need to be included in your apt sources, just type **sudo eggs update** and choose fresh eggs from the basket.

## Features 
Created on Debian buster (stable) support jessie (old-old-stable), stretch (old-stable) and bullseye (testing).

Support: i386/amd64 BIOS/UEFI with follow distros and derivates: Debian jessie/ stretch/ buster/ bullseye, Devuan beowulf, Ubuntu xenial/ bionic/ focal/ groovy and derivates (linuxmint, neon et others)

Fast: does not copy the original filesystem but the livefs is obtained instantly, through binding and overlay. In addition, the --fast option creates the ISO using zstd, reducing compression time during the development up to 10 times!

Safe: only use the original distro's packages, without any modification in your repository lists.

CLI and GUI: eggs is a utility cli, but we added two ligher GUI interfaces: mom and dad. Use mom to interact and learn eggs commands, and dad to quicly create an iso.

Script: if you want full control on the production of your iso, try the flag --script in produce. eggs will generate filesystem directory, iso structure complete and the related scripts to bind/ubind live filesystem, squash it and create or re-create yours iso as much times as you need.

Book: user's guide in italian language and manual or automatic translations in others languages.

Supported: I'm trying to give you as documentation and support is possible: sources, automatic documentation sources, user's guide, facebook page and group, telegram group penguinseggs and gitter. 

Community: currently the biggest problem with this software is the lack of a community. I hope that over time it will grow. You can help by following the project and helping to spread it. "No man is an island entire of itself..." John Donne
