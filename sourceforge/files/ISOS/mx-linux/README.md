# MX Linux

[MX Linux](https://mxlinux.org/) is a cooperative venture between the [antiX](https://antixlinux.com/) and MX Linux communities. It is a family of operating systems that are designed to combine elegant and efficient desktops with high stability and solid performance.  MX’s graphical tools provide an easy way to do a wide variety of tasks, while the Live USB and snapshot tools inherited from antiX add impressive portability and remastering capabilities. Extensive support is available through videos, documentation and a very friendly Forum.

* **egg-of-mx-bookworm-xfce** - remastered version from MX23 XFCE
* **egg-of-mx-bookworm-plasma** - remastered version from MX23 KDE

**NOTE**: original [MX-Linux ISOs](https://mxlinux.org/download-links/) have [mx-snapshot](https://github.com/MX-Linux/mx-snapshot) and [mx-installer](https://github.com/MX-Linux/mx-installer) inside, here both are removed in favour of [penguins-eggs](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs) and [calamares](https://github.com/calamares/calamares).

# Installing MX Linux via PXE

One feature of ISO images made with eggs is the ability to be used for network installation . All you have to do is boot the ISO to be installed, open a terminal window and type the command: 

```sudo eggs cuckoo```.

Then all you have to do is boot from the network the machines to be installed and start the calamares or krill installer.

You can also perform an unattended installation with krill, see the [manual](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/english) or, find assistance in the [telegram Penguins' eggs](https://t.me/penguins_eggs) group.
