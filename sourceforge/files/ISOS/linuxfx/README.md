# LinuxFX

[LunuxFX](https://www.windowsfx.org/) LinuxFX is a Brazilian distribution, currently based on Ubuntu jammy and, therefore, very up-to-date. What characterizes it is mainly the graphics in full Windows 11 style, but the capabilities should not be underestimated - to run Windows applications. It is currently ranked 22 on distrowatch, and for this kind of distribution it is certainly a good position. Without thinking too much about it I come to suggest it for facilitating the transition of users from Windows to Linux in companies, remastered with eggs it naturally allows installation via PXE and unattended and, for that may be even more interesting.

I lack information about real compatibility with Windows programs, generally many vertical applications developed with Visual Basic 6 and using ADO, should not work, I hope to be proven wrong.

## HOWTO
I wrote this fast howto to give same explanations: [HOWTO](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs/tree/master/sourceforge/files/ISOS/linuxfx/HOWTO.md)

* **egg-of-linuxfx-jammy-plasma** A remastered version of LinuxFX theme plasma
* **egg-of-linuxfx-jammy-cinnamon** A remastered version of LinuxFX theme cinnamon

# Installing LinuxFX via PXE

One feature of ISO images made with eggs is the ability to be used for network installation . All you have to do is boot the ISO to be installed, open a terminal window and type the command: 

```sudo eggs cuckoo```.

Then all you have to do is boot from the network the machines to be installed and start the calamares or krill installer.

You can also perform an unattended installation with krill, see the [manual](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/english) or, find assistance in the [telegram Penguins' eggs](https://t.me/penguins_eggs) group.
