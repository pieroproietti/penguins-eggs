# Plastilinux
Plastilinux would like to become a meta-distribution for school and be based on different custom Linux distributions using the [wardrobe](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-wardrobe/tree/main/DOCUMENTATION#penguins-wardrobe) of [eggs](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs).

## chicks
XFCE4, light customization office, code, nodejs and school programs.

## Integration with epoptes.
I have included in eggs an integration function with [epoptes](https://epoptes.org/), thanks to which from an installed machine, creating an image with ``sudo eggs produce`` and starting ``sudo eggs cuckoo`` the machines started via PXE can be controlled with [epoptes](https://epoptes.org/).

* ```live/evolution``
* ```root/evolution```

## **colibri**
A light xfce4 for developers you can easily start to improve eggs by installing colibri.

## **duck**
cinnamon, office, multimedia and all that is needed for most users

## **owl**
xfce4 for graphics designers, with 6.1.15-2-liquorix-amd64 kernel, based on the work of Clarlie Martinez

# Virtualization
I have discovered Proxmox VE since version 0.7 and have been using it for many, many years. Proxmox VE is based on Debian stable, and allows easy management of remotely manageable virtual machines through an excellent web interface.

Eagle is nothing more than a workstation based on Proxmox VE to which has been added an XFCE GUI, virtual-viewer and spice-vdagent, the result is a system that can be used both as a traditional workstation and as a virtualizer.

## **eagle**
xfce4 desktop plus [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve), install and configure it with static ip to enjoy KVM and containers virtualization.

**Note**: There are some new additions in this version:

* system automatically sets a line `hostname x.x.x.x` in `/etc/hosts`, this let proxmox-ve to start also from a live system;
* during installation command `sudo ssh-keygen -A` is used to reset keys;

it would be interesting if some Proxmox VE expert would take over this ISO, which could also be useful for maintenance operations on pre-existing servers, being a complete and functional Proxmox VE system even from live.
