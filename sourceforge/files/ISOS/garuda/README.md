# Garuda

[Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org/) is a rolling distribution based on the Arch Linux operating system. Unlike Arch Linux, Garuda Linux comes with a graphical installer (Calamares) for easy installation, and other advanced graphical tools for managing your system. Garuda is a performance-oriented distro with many performance enhancing tweaks. Some of the many tweaks include using zram, a performance CPU governor, along with custom memory management software. Garuda Linux has striven to provide system stability by including the Timeshift backup utility.

## Note
On Garuda Linux I'm on the first steps, so for now You must install with krill: `sudo eggs install -un`, also, I was currently only able to remaster Garuda from an ext4 installation, but not from btrfs.

I hope to solve the problems soon maybe with some collaboration.
