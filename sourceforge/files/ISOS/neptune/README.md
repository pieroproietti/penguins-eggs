# Penguins' eggs remastered ISOs

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

All ISOs include eggs, you can udate it with: ```sudo eggs update```.

# NeptuneOS

This is a remaster - made with eggs - of Neptune 8.0 "Juna".

I just downloaded the original ISO, installed it, give a general update and installed penguins-eggs.

After that, just:

`sudo eggs dad -d`
`sudo eggs calamares --install`
`sudo eggs produce --max --release`

I used flag `--release` to remove penguins-eggs and calamares at the end of installation.

From their site:

We are proud to announce the release of Neptune 8.0 ("Juna"). This is the first major release of version 8.0 based on Debian 12  ("Bookworm")

This version comes with the latest major underlying changes from Debian 12 ("Bookworm").

The Linux Kernel has been updated to Version 6.1 to provide support for new hardware and better compatibility with current hardware. Additionally, KDE Plasma has been upgraded to version 5.27 along with all KDE applications present in version 22.12.3.
