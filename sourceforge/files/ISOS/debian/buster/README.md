# Debian remastered ISOs

All ISOs are based on Debian buster, Debian bullseye

# Debian buster 

* **naked** - just the juice, without GUI. You can start here to build your revolution! (i386 and amd64)
* **xfce** - it's not naked, but just dressed with xfce4 and the tools to develop. (i386 and amd64)
* **lxqt** - it's not naked, but just dressed with lxqt and the tools to develop. (i386 and amd64)
* **cinnamon**  - was my personal version with cinnamon, mostly for development, but include common office tools; (amd64)
