# Debian remastered ISOs

All ISOs are based on Debian stretch

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

* **egg-of-debian-stretch-naked** - just the juice, without GUI. You can start here to build your revolution! (i386)
* **egg-of-debian-stretch-lite** - it's not naked, but just dressed with xfce4 and same tools to develop. (i386)
* **egg-of-debian-stretch-lxqt**  - it's not naked, but just dressed with xfce4 and same  tools to develop. (i386)

I made this version in the hope it can be usefull for old computers. **There are a lot of distros you can try, but with eggs the question is a bit different: you can easily rebuild your version on a virtual machine, change every aspects, check if you need other software, check the precence the drivers you need and install them**. 

At last you can produce your personal iso image for your old pc.

I think it is fantastic, but of course it'isent the shortest way! :-p

# No GUI installer here!!!

Debian stretch is an old version of Debian, can't use calamares installer. 

Well, we can use eggs cli installer.

```sudo eggs install --cli```

and follow the instructions.

__Note__ Be sure to work without risks, cli installer can delete all yours datas, can't coesist with others system, etc. Use at your own risk. Backup your data before to try and use only for old machines - for new ones use calamares - no warranties here.
