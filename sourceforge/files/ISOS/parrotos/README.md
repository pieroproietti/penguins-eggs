# Parrot OS

The operating system for Security specialist.

I don't know if a good idea to remaster parrot, due it's security nature. But it's a Debian and it's a bird, so...

## Why "Parrot"?
Because it was born as a game, and every pirate of the seven seas needs a parrot on his shoulders if he wants to board the galleons with his crew of jailbird filibusters.
