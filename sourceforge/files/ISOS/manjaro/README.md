# Installing manjaro Linux with krill
If you need to do OEM installations you can also use the eggs CLI installation called krill. 

The installation is destructive, so be careful, however, it is very fast and can be completed in unattended mode.

What you need to do is simply open a terminal and type: `sudo eggs install` for interactive mode, or `sudo eggs install --unattended` for unattended mode.

# Installing manjaro Linux via PXE

One feature of ISO images made with eggs is the ability to be used for network installation . All you have to do is boot the ISO to be installed, open a terminal window and type the command: 

```sudo eggs cuckoo```.

Then all you have to do is boot from the network the machines to be installed and start the calamares or krill installer.

You can also perform an unattended installation with krill, see the [manual](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/english) or, find assistance in the [telegram Penguins' eggs](https://t.me/penguins_eggs) group.

# More informations
There is a [Penguins' eggs official guide](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/eggs-users-guide) and same other documentation - mostly for developers - on the repository [penguins-eggs](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs) under [DOCUMENTATION](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs/tree/master/DOCUMENTATION). I want to point out [hens, differents species](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs/blob/master/documents/hens-different-species.md) a brief how to use eggs in Debian. Arch and Manjaro, and the post [Arch-naked](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/archlinux-naked.html) on the blog which describes how to create an Arch naked live, install it, then dress the resulting system with a graphics development station.
