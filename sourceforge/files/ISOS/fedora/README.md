# Penguins' eggs remastered ISOs

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

# Fedora

* **egg-of-fedora-naked** (CLI, minimal reproductive installation)
* **egg-of-fedora-colibri** (XFCE, devtools)

Fedora doesn't need much introduction, Redhat was the first Linux I managed to install back in 2000, then I switched to Debian and a lot of others.
