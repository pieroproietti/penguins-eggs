# Penguins' eggs remixes ISOs

All ISOs are based on Arch, Debian, Devuan, Manjaro, Ubuntu or derivates (LinuxFx, Linuxmint, MX-Linux, RebornOS, SpiralLinux, etc).

You can boot this live images burning them on USB key - using [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) is a great opportunity - or via PXE, booting from LAN, just ```sudo eggs cuckoo``` or  ```sudo eggs cuckoo --real```

To install the system you have 3 ways:

* GUI installer calamares
* TUI installer krill
* TUI installer krill --unattended

## user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

All the ISOs include eggs >= 9.3.x

# Installing ISOS via PXE

One feature of ISO images made with eggs is the ability to be used for network installation . All you have to do is boot the ISO to be installed, open a terminal window and type the command: 

```sudo eggs cuckoo```.

Then all you have to do is boot from the network the machines to be installed and start the calamares or krill installer.

You can also perform an unattended installation with krill, see the [manual](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/english) or, find assistance in the [telegram Penguins' eggs](https://t.me/penguins_eggs) group.

There is a [Penguins' eggs official guide](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/eggs-users-guide) and same other documentation - mostly for developers - on the repository [penguins-eggs](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs) under [documents](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs/tree/master/documents).

Arch and Manjaro, and the post [Arch-naked](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/archlinux-naked.html) on the blog which describes how to create an Arch naked live, install it, then dress the resulting system with a graphics development station.
