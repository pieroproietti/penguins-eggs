# AlpineLinux Small. Simple. Secure.

[AlpineLinux](https://alpinelinux.org/), is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox.

* **egg-of-alpine-colibri** An experimental version from Alpine standard. I need your feedback, look on discussion [Way to Alpine](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs/discussions/377).

NOTE: Yuo can add `linux-firmware` to use on real hardware.

* You can find more informations on this Linux distro at: [AlpineLinux](https://alpinelinux.org/).

# Important notes 

This image will boot only on BIOS systems and will go on `emergency shell`. From the emergency shell, just type "exit" to boot the live

The main limits of this remasters, are: 

* my Alpine remastered is not yet able to boot from ISO on UEFI;
* I wrote a [package for Alpine](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/pieroproietti/aports/-/tree/master/testing/penguins-eggs) on testing.
* will be nice to use calamares as GUI installaer - there is an [Alpine calamares package](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=calamares&branch=v3.14) from Oliver Smith on community for Alpine 3.14, but was not able to update.

However remastering and reinstalling AlpineLinux is quite fast and this allows big progress by facilitating debugging, after all I started using this distribution less than month.

Extend penguins-eggs to Alpine Linux is a work in progress, please help!

## Video
I did a video: produce an ISO from Alpine Linux, boot another system with the live and install it using krill a CLI system installer.
