# Penguins' eggs remastered ISOs

All ISOs are based on Rhino Linux 

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

# Rhino Linux
Rhino Linux re-invents the Ubuntu experience as a rolling release distribution atop a stable Desktop Environment. Pacstall is at the very heart of the distribution, providing essential packages such as the Linux kernel, Firefox, Rhino Linux specific applications and theming.

All ISOs include eggs, you can udate it with: ```sudo eggs update```.

* **egg-of-ubuntu-devel-xfce** - a remaster of [Rhino Linu x86_64](https://github.com/rhino-linux/os/releases/download/2023.1-beta5/Rhino-Linux-2023.1-beta5-amd64.iso)


# Calamares notes
If you want to use the original rhino theme - adapted to eggs - just use the following commands:

* `eggs wardrobe get`
* `sudo eggs produce --max --theme .wardrobe/themes/rhino`

Krill: It is still possible to install this version, by opening a terminal window and proceeding with the CLI installer, just use the command: `sudo eggs install`.
