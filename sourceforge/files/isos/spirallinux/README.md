# Penguins' eggs remastered ISOs

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

# warning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually this ISO can be installed just with: sudo eggs install -un

Calamares give a problem with the script /usr/sbin/bootloader-config.sh, unfortunately I was not able to solve.

Peoples can try to give back the solutions! ;-)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

All the ISOs include nodejs and eggs installed (.npm package), so you can update your eggs tool with the command:

```sudo eggs update```

# SpiralLinux remastered ISOs

All ISOs are based on [SpiralLinux](https://spirallinux.github.io/)

SpiralLinux is a selection of Linux spins built from Debian GNU/Linux, with a focus on simplicity and out-of-the-box usability across all the major desktop environments. SpiralLinux serves as an alternative live installation method for a highly reliable customized Debian system using only official Debian package repositories.

I wish this distribution great popularity because it is based on good principles: making Debian immediately usable for the masses and introducing btrfs.

__Please note what this project is in no way connected to the original distro in any official way, it’s just my personal experiment.__
