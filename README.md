# Introduction

`penguins-eggs` is the package name of `eggs` a console tool, under continuous development, that allows you to remaster your system and redistribute it as live images on USB sticks or via PXE. 

The concept behind Penguins’ Eggs stems from the idea of “reproduction” and “population selection” applied to operating systems. During the era of popular remastering programs like Remastersys and Systemback, both of which experienced maintenance issues and were eventually abandoned, the need for a new, modern tool became evident. 

The inspiration for Penguins’ Eggs led to the development of a new tool written in a modern, cross-distribution language, utilizing its own packaging system. 

Initially built with javascript and then switched to Typescript as the main development language, the design of the tool resembles an egg production process, consisting of operations such as produce to create the eggs and hatch to install them (I changed a bit later: from hatch to install, then to krill as a tribute to calamares tribes).

Other commands follow: like `kill` for removing produced ISOs, `calamares` for configuring the graphical installer, `mom` as interactive help, `dad` to configure eggs, `status`, `tools`, etc.

Considered a work-in-progress, the ultimate goal of Penguins' Eggs is to allow the creation of live ISOs from an installed system and their use for system installations.  It can be used both to create images on USB devices - even [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) - and as a PXE server to distribute the image itself over a local network. Inspired by the behavior of the cuckoo bird, which depends on others to hatch its eggs.

Written primarily in TypeScript, Penguins’ Eggs is designed to be compatible with various Linux distributions, despite differences in package managers, file paths, and more. 

The tool currently supports Debian, Devuan, Ubuntu, Arch, Manjaro, and their derivatives, across multiple architectures including amd64, i386, and arm64. 

From the release of version 9.6.x, Penguins’ Eggs is available as a [Debian package](https://penguins-eggs.net/basket/index.php?p=packages%2Fdebs), then was extended to Arch Linux creating the relative [PKGBUILD](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/penguins-eggs), nowday eggs can remaster AlmaLinux, Fedora, openmamba, openSuSE, RockyLinux too.

So, catering to a wide range of systems including PCs, older machines, and single-board ARM systems like the Raspberry Pi, across amd64, i386, and arm64 architectures. 

For more information and updates, visit the [Penguins’ Eggs official website](https://penguins-eggs.net).


 > [!TIP]
>   `eggs` is an actively developed console tool designed to help you customize and distribute your system as live images on USB sticks or through PXE. By using this tool, you can remaster your system according to your preferences.

> [!TIP]
>  By default, `eggs` completely removes the system's data and users. However, it also offers the option to remaster the system while including the data and accounts of existing users. This can be done using the `--clone` flag. Additionally, you can preserve the users and files by storing them in an encrypted LUKS file within the resulting ISO file, which can be achieved with the `--cryptedclone` flag.

> [!TIP]
>  The resulting live system can be easily installed using either the calamares installer or the internal TUI krill installer. Furthermore, using `krill`, you can easily get an unattended installation, utilizing `--unattended` and various [krill](#eggs-krill) flags.

> [!TIP]
>  One interesting feature of `eggs` is its integration with the `penguins-wardrobe` This allows you to create or utilize scripts to switch between different configurations. For example, you can start with a bare version of the system, featuring only a command-line interface (CLI), and then easily transition to a full graphical user interface (GUI) or server configurations.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information and customization options, you can explore `penguins-wardrobe`. a related project. You can fork it and adapt it to meet your specific needs.

See [penguins-wardrobe](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-wardrobe), fork it, and adapt it to your needs.

# Technology
 `eggs` is primarily written in TypeScript and is designed to be compatible with various Linux distributions. While there may be differences in package managers, paths, and other aspects, the underlying programs used to build the live system are generally the same.

Currently, `eggs` supports several Linux distributions, including [AlmaLinux](https://almalinux.org/), [Arch](https://archlinux.org/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), [Devuan](https://www.devuan.org/), [LinuxMint](https://www.linuxmint.com/), [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), [openmamba](https://openmamba.org/), [openSuSE](https://www.opensuse.org/), [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), [RockyLinux](https://rockylinux.org/) and [derivatives](./conf/derivatives.yaml).

It also caters to different architectures, namely `amd64`, `i386`, and `arm64`.

Starting from version 9.6.x, `penguins-eggs` is released as a Debian package, available for amd64, i386, and arm64 architectures. This allows it to support a wide range of PCs, including older machines, as well as single-board ARM systems like the Raspberry Pi.

## Wardrobe, Themes, and Addons
 In April 2022, the `wardrobe` command was introduced to `eggs`. This addition serves as a comprehensive tool to assist and streamline the process of creating a customized version of Linux, starting from a command-line interface (CLI) system. I have embraced wardrobe for all my editions to enhance convenience, enabling me to better organize, consolidate, and manage my work effectively.
To add a unique touch to my customizations, I have assigned bird names to each edition. Except for the "naked" edition, there are various options available, including "Colibri," "eagle," "duck," "owl," and "chicks" under the bookworm and plastilinux distributions. [bookworm](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/files/ISOS/debian/bookworm/)  and [plastilinux](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/files/ISOS/plastilinux/),.Furthermore, under Waydroid on the eggs' SourceForge page, you can find "wagtail" and "warbier."
I have high hopes that people will take an interest in wardrobe and consider forking the main repository to incorporate their own customizations. By collaborating, we can achieve significant progress that would be challenging for a single developer to accomplish. If you would like to delve deeper into the wardrobe, I recommend reading the [Penguins' eggs blog](https://penguins-eggs.net/blog/wardrobe-colibri-duck-eagle-and-owl/). post titled Wardrobe: Colibri, Duck, Eagle, and Owl, which provides further insights into its features and benefits.
Furthermore, addons, predominantly themes, have been organized under the vendor's folder in the penguin's wardrobe. I encourage utilizing your wardrobe for all your customization needs to maintain consistency and organization throughout your work.

> [!NOTE]
> For detailed instructions on using a wardrobe, please consult the wardrobe users' guide  [wardrobe users' guide](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/wardrobe-users-guide).


## Clone/Cryptedclone
When creating a live distribution of your system, you have different options to consider: the default mode, clone, and cryptedclone.
•	The default mode, achieved by using the command `eggs produce`, completely removes user data from the live distribution. This ensures that no private data remains in the live system.
 
•	The `eggs produce --clone` command allows you to save both user data and system data directly in the generated ISO. This means that if someone obtains a copy of the ISO, they will be able to see and access the 
user data directly from the live system. It's important to note that this data is not encrypted, so it may not be suitable for sensitive information.
 
•	On the other hand, the ìeggs produce --cryptedclone` command saves the data within the generated ISO using a LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) volume. With this option, the user data will not be visible in the live system. However, it can be automatically reinstalled during the system installation process using the "krill" installer. Even if someone has the generated ISO, they won't be able to access the user data without the LUKS passphrase. This ensures that your data remains protected.

To summarize the available options:

•	`eggs produce` (default): All private data is removed from the live system.

•	`eggs produce --clone`: All user data is included unencrypted directly in the live system.

•	`eggs produce --cryptedclone`: All user data is included encrypted within a LUKS volume inside the ISO.
> [!TIP]
>    During the installation process, you can use the "krill" installer to restore your crypted data automatically. By running the command "sudo eggs install" with the "krill" installer, your encrypted data will be securely transferred and made available in the installed system.


## calamares and krill
 Calamares and Krill are powerful tools in the Eggs project, [calamares](https://calamares.io), offering versatile installation options for Linux systems. The Eggs project was specifically designed to utilize Calamares as the default system installer, providing users with the flexibility to customize their installations using themes. However, Eggs goes beyond Calamares by introducing its own installer called Krill, which focuses on command-line interface (CLI) installations, particularly for server environments.

 Krill adopts a TUI interface that closely resembles Calamares, ensuring a consistent user experience. Leveraging the same configuration files created by Eggs for Calamares, Krill maintains compatibility and allows for seamless transitions between desktop and server installations. By simply adding the flag during installation, Krill enables unattended installations, streamlining the process for system administrators. Fine-tuning installation parameters becomes effortless as the configuration values can be modified in the ```/etc/penguins-eggs.d/krill.yaml``` file, facilitating automated deployments.

> [!TIP]
> Thanks to the Eggs project's integration of Calamares and the introduction of Krill, users can enjoy a comprehensive installation toolkit. Whether one prefers the graphical interface of Calamares or the command-line efficiency of Krill, Eggs caters to diverse installation needs, making Linux setup a breeze.

## cuckoo 
 Just like the cuckoo bird lays its eggs in the nests of other birds, the Eggs project introduces a similar concept in the form of a self-configuring PXE service. This service allows you to boot and install your ISO on networked computers that are not originally configured for your specific ISO.
With the command `cuckoo` you can deploy a newly created ISO on an already installed system, or you can live to boot the ISO itself. This means that you can either install your ISO on existing systems or directly run the ISO without the need for a permanent installation.

> [!TIP]
>  By leveraging the cuckoo command, the Eggs project provides a convenient method for deploying and testing your ISO on a variety of networked computers, expanding the possibilities for system installations and evaluations.

## mom and dad
 I have introduced two helpful built-in assistants: Mom and Dad. Mom, based on the easybashgui [easybashgui](https://github.com/BashGui/easybashgui) script, serves as a comprehensive guide, providing explanations of various commands and documentation. This ensures that users have access to clear instructions and information as they navigate through Eggs' functionalities.
On the other hand, Dad serves as a convenient shortcut for properly configuring Eggs. By simply typing ```sudo eggs dad``` and following the straightforward instructions, users can quickly configure Eggs to meet their specific requirements. For even faster configuration, utilizing the command ```sudo eggs dad -d``` allows for a complete reset of the configuration, loading default settings, and deleting any created ISOs.
Once Eggs is properly configured, generating your live environment becomes a breeze. Just type ```sudo eggs produce``` to effortlessly generate your live ISO. With this streamlined workflow, Eggs empowers users to efficiently create customized live environments tailored to their needs. Whether you rely on Mom's guidance or Dad's configuration shortcuts, Eggs offers a user-friendly experience for ISO creation and customization.

## yolk 
 Yolk is a local repository that is bundled within the LiveCD of Eggs. This repository contains a carefully curated selection of essential packages required for installation. Yolk serves as a valuable resource, as it allows you to install your system confidently, even without an active internet connection.
By including Yolk in the LiveCD, Eggs ensures that all the necessary packages are readily available during the installation process. This eliminates the dependency on an internet connection, making it possible to install your system in offline environments or situations where internet access is limited or unavailable.
Yolk acts as a safety net, providing the minimum set of indispensable packages required for a successful installation. This guarantees a smooth and reliable installation experience, regardless of the availability of an internet connection. With Yolk by your side, you can confidently proceed with system installations, knowing that the essential packages are at your disposal.

Whether you're using Buster, Bullseye, Bookworm, Trixie, Chimaera, Daedalus, Focal, Jammy or Noble, `eggs` is reported to work across these versions. However, it's important to ensure compatibility with the respective processor architecture.

Ubuntu bionic cannot install nodejs >16, so I packaged a specific version for bionic, still largely used.

The packages `penguins-eggs` provided include standard scripts for `preinst`, `postinst`, `prerm`, and `postrm`. These scripts play a crucial role in the installation and management of the packages. The preinst script is executed before the package is installed, allowing for any necessary preparations or configurations. The postinst script is executed after the package installation, enabling additional setup or customization. Similarly, the prerm script is executed before the package is removed, while the postrm script is executed after the package removal.

In addition to the scripts, `penguins-eggs` package also include man pages, bash-completion and other.

 man pages serve as documentation for the installed packages, providing detailed information on their usage, configuration options, and other relevant details. The inclusion of man pages ensures that users have access to comprehensive documentation, enabling them to effectively utilize and manage the Eggs packages.

Overall, Eggs' packages offer a comprehensive and user-friendly experience, with standard scripts and detailed documentation, making installation and management hassle-free on Debian, Devuan, and Ubuntu-based distributions.


### Install eggs
 There are multiple methods available, lately I prefer `get-eggs` way, working for all the supported distros: Arch, Debian, Devuan, Manjaro, Ubuntu and derivatives.:

 ```
 git clone https://github.com/pieroproietti/get-eggs
 cd get-eggs
 sudo ./get-eggs.sh
 ```

`get-eggs` on Debian families add automatically the `penguins-eggs-ppa` repository and, when need, add `nodesource` repository. On Arch, `chaotic-aur` repo will be added.

This let to install, update, remove `penguins-eggs` like a native package.

#### Debian families
`penguins-eggs-10.0.x` depend on `nodejs >18`, not directly available in all the distros. We can rely on [nodesource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions?tab=readme-ov-file#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions) adding them.

##### Download and install penguins-eggs packages
 To install Eggs, the simplest method is to download the package `penguins-eggs` from the project's SourceForge page  [package eggs](https://penguins-eggs.net/basket/index.php?p=packages%2Fdebs) and install it on your system.

After downloading the appropriate package, based on your system's architecture, you can proceed with the installation. If you are using an amd64 system, run the following command in the terminal:

```sudo dpkg -i penguins_eggs_10.0.x-1_amd64.deb```

For i386 systems, the command would be:
```sudo dpkg -i penguins_eggs_10.0.x-1_i386.deb```

Executing these commands will initiate the installation process and install Eggs on your system.
Once Eggs is successfully installed, you have the option to enhance its functionality by adding the penguins-eggs-ppa repository. This repository provides additional tools and features for Eggs. To add the penguins-eggs-ppa repository, run the following command in the terminal:
```sudo eggs tools ppa --install```
This command will add the penguins-eggs-ppa repository to your system, allowing you to access updated versions of Eggs and additional tools provided by the repository.
By following these steps, you can easily install Eggs, add the penguins-eggs-ppa repository, [penguins-eggs-ppa](https://pieroproietti.github.io/penguins-eggs-ppa), and unlock further capabilities and enhancements for your Eggs installation.

##### Using penguins-eggs-ppa
For derivatives of Debian, Devuan, and Ubuntu, such as Linuxmint, LMDE, etc., `get-eggs` will typically work as well. However, if needed, you can manually add the penguins-eggs-ppa repository by copying and pasting the following two lines into a terminal:

```
curl -fsSL https://pieroproietti.github.io/penguins-eggs-ppa/KEY.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/penguins-eggs.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] https://pieroproietti.github.io/penguins-eggs-ppa ./" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/penguins-eggs.list > /dev/null

These methods provide various ways to install penguins-eggs on Arch Linux, allowing you to choose the one that suits your preferences and workflow.


### Manjaro
 Starting from version 9.4.3, penguins-eggs is now included in the Manjaro community repository, making it even easier to install on Manjaro Linux. To install penguins-eggs on Manjaro, you can use the `pamac` package manager with the following command:
```
pamac install penguins-eggs
```
This command will fetch the package from the Manjaro community repository and install it on your system.

Alternatively, if you prefer to manually manage the installation process, you can clone the penguins-eggs package from the Manjaro community repository and build it from source. Here are the steps:

1. Clone the penguins-eggs package from the Manjaro community repository:
```
git clone https://gitlab.manjaro.org/packages/community/penguins-eggs/
```

2. Change to the penguins-eggs directory:
```
cd penguins-eggs
```

3. Build and install the package using `makepkg`:
```
makepkg -srcCi
```
> [!TIP]
> This command will compile the source code, create a package, and install it on your system.

 By including penguins-eggs in the Manjaro community repository, Manjaro Linux users can easily access and install the package using their preferred package manager. The Manjaro community repository is specifically dedicated to packages that are supported by the Manjaro community, ensuring that penguins-eggs is well-integrated and compatible with the Manjaro distribution.

> [!TIP]
> Whether you choose to install penguins-eggs using `pamac` or by manually building it from source, you can enjoy the benefits of this package on your Manjaro Linux system.


# Usage
 Once the package has been installed, you can have the new ```eggs``` command. Typing ```eggs``` will get the list of commands, and typing ```eggs produce --help``` will get the eggs produce command help screen. You can also use the command autocomplete with the TABS key, you will get the possible choices for each command. In addition, there is a man page, so by typing ```man eggs``` you will get that help as well. You can also use the ```eggs mom``` command that interactively allows you to consult the help for all commands and online documentation.

## Examples
Here are some examples of how to use penguins-eggs to create live systems with different configurations:

1. To create a live system without user data, run the following command with `sudo`:
```
sudo eggs produce
```
This command will generate a live system without any user data included.

2. To create a live system with user data that is not encrypted, use the `--clone` flag:
```
sudo eggs produce --clone
```
This command will produce a live system that includes user data without encryption.

3. If you want to create a live system with encrypted user data, use the `--cryptedclone` flag:
```
sudo eggs produce --cryptedclone
```
This command will generate a live system with encrypted user data.

## Compression
By default, penguins-eggs uses fasted compression `zstd level 3` for efficiency during the creation process. However, if you want a more compressed ISO file, you can chooce `--pendrive` flag `zstd level 15` optimized for pendrives, `--standard` flag, use  `xz`, or `--max` flag using `xz -Xbcj` to get the maximun level of compression. For example:

```
sudo eggs produce 
sudo eggs produce --pendrive
sudo eggs produce --standard
sudo eggs produce --max
```
> [!TIP]
>  This command will apply differents compression to the ISO file, resulting in a smaller file size or in a longer process. Consult [Penguins' eggs official guide](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/eggs-users-guide) for more detailed informations.

## penGUI take cure of eggs!

 The development of a GUI for `eggs` with the penGUI project sounds promising. It's exciting to see that work on the GUI has started and is progressing rapidly. GUIs can greatly enhance the user experience and make it more accessible to a wider range of users. I hope the penGUI [penGUI](https://github.com/pieroproietti/pengui) project continues to thrive and brings a user-friendly interface to `penguins-eggs`. If you have any specific questions or need further information about the penGUI project, feel free to ask!


## That's all, Folks!

 One of the standout features of Penguins' Eggs is its hassle-free setup. It comes with all the necessary configurations, making it a convenient choice for users. Just like in real life, the magic of Penguins' Eggs lies within - no additional setup required! 

## More Information

In addition to the official guide, there are other resources available for Penguins' Eggs users, particularly developers. These resources can be found in the [penguins-eggs repository](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs) under the [documents](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs/tree/master/documents) section.

Some noteworthy documents include:
- [Hens: Different Species](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs/blob/master//hens-different-species.md): A brief guide on using Penguins' Eggs in Debian, Arch, and Manjaro.
- [Arch-naked](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/archlinux-naked.html): A blog post detailing how to create an Arch naked live, install it, and customize the resulting system into a graphics development station.
