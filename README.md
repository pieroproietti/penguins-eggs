# oa-tools - A Next Generation Remastering Suite 🐧

Welcome to **oa-tools**, the evolution of the [penguins-eggs](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs) experience, from the same author. This monorepo hosts a split-responsibility system designed for high-performance Linux remastering, following the "Universal Strategy" for absolute portability.

The project is divided into two distinct entities: **oa** (the workhorse) and **coa** (the orchestrator). For maximum flexibility, the system can be used interchangeably with the `coa` command or its `eggs` alias.


## 🏗 Project Architecture

We have transitioned to a monorepo structure to ensure perfect synchronization between the workhorse (oa) and the orchestrator (coa).

### 🦾 [oa (eggs in my dialect)](./DOCS/README.md) - The Workhorse
**Language: C**
`oa` is the low-level engine. It handles the "heavy lifting" of the system:
- Managing OverlayFS and mount points.
- Executing SquashFS compression.
- Remove and create users and groupt via yocto_style functions.
- Interacting directly with the Linux Kernel and system binaries.
- **Philosophy:** Performance, stability, and zero-dependency execution.

### 🧠 [coa (brooding in my dialect)](./DOCS/README.md) - The Orchestrator
It manages the full lifecycle: from laying the ISO to the final installation.

The name derives from the dialect word coa, referring to the act of brooding or incubating eggs until they are ready to hatch.

**Language: Go**

For coa commands, see [coa command Reference](/DOCS/COA_COMMANDS.md).


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Linux system (Debian-based, Arch-based. Fedora-based or Manjaro-based).
- `gcc` and `make` (for `oa`).
- `golang` 1.21+ (for `coa`).

### Build Everything
From this root directory, simply run:
```bash
make
```

This will compile both binaries:
- `./oa/oa` (The Engine)
- `./coa/coa` (The Orchestrator)

> TIP: You can create native package like: .deb, PKGBUILD, rpm using
```
coa/coa build
```

## 📜 Philosophy
The **oa-tools** project aims to provide a "Passepartout" for Linux remastering. By separating the **Mind** (Go) from the **Workhorse** (C), we achieve a clean, maintainable, and incredibly fast workflow that can adapt to any distribution without changing the user experience.

Documentation about oa-tools can be found on [DOCS](/DOCS/).
