 `eggs` is primarily written in TypeScript and is designed to be compatible with various Linux distributions. While there may be differences in package managers, paths, and other aspects, the underlying programs used to build the live system are generally the same.
 > [!TIP]
 and major derivatives like: Linuxmint, KDE neon, EndeavourOS, Garuda, etc. You can easily add more derivatives.
 Being present in the AUR signifies that Eggs is available for Arch Linux users to easily install and manage through their package managers. The AUR is a community-driven repository that allows users to contribute and maintain packages that are not officially supported by Arch Linux. By maintaining the AUR version of penguins-eggs, I can ensure that Arch Linux users have access to the latest updates and improvements for Eggs.
 By including penguins-eggs in the Manjaro community repository, Manjaro Linux users can easily access and install the package using their preferred package manager. The Manjaro community repository is specifically dedicated to packages that are supported by the Manjaro community, ensuring that penguins-eggs is well-integrated and compatible with the Manjaro distribution.
 Calamares and Krill are powerful tools in the Eggs project, [calamares](https://calamares.io), offering versatile installation options for Linux systems. The Eggs project was specifically designed to utilize Calamares as the default system installer, providing users with the flexibility to customize their installations using themes. However, Eggs goes beyond Calamares by introducing its own installer called Krill, which focuses on command-line interface (CLI) installations, particularly for server environments.
 cd get-eggs
 Eggs has been available in the Arch User Repository (AUR) for quite some time, thanks to the support of the Arch Linux community. Although I was initially unaware of its presence, I am now directly maintaining the AUR version of [penguins-eggs](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/penguins-eggs). Additionally, I am actively participating in the Manjaro Community Repository, specifically for the [penguins-eggs](https://gitlab.manjaro.org/packages/community/penguins-eggs) package.
 Eggs offers support for a variety of packages. Specifically, for Debian, Devuan, and Ubuntu, Eggs utilizes .deb packages that are compatible with both amd_64 and i386 architectures. This ensures seamless integration with these distributions, allowing users to easily install and utilize Eggs' features.
 git clone https://github.com/pieroproietti/get-eggs
 I have introduced two helpful built-in assistants: Mom and Dad. Mom, based on the easybashgui [easybashgui](https://github.com/BashGui/easybashgui) script, serves as a comprehensive guide, providing explanations of various commands and documentation. This ensures that users have access to clear instructions and information as they navigate through Eggs' functionalities.
 In addition to ISO creation, Penguins-eggs offers a unique feature called Cuckoo. By starting Cuckoo from the live system, you can set up a PXE boot server, making it accessible to all computers on the network. This functionality opens up possibilities for network booting and streamlined deployment. Penguins Eggs Linux ushers in a new era of innovation and convenience with its groundbreaking default feature, Cuckoo live network boot, which transforms any computer running Penguins Eggs into a PXE (Preboot eXecution Environment) boot server. This revolutionary paradigm of network booting and seamless deployment underscores Penguins Eggs Linux’s commitment to redefining the parameters of accessibility and efficiency within the realm of Linux distributions.
 In April 2022, the `wardrobe` command was introduced to `eggs`. This addition serves as a comprehensive tool to assist and streamline the process of creating a customized version of Linux, starting from a command-line interface (CLI) system. I have embraced wardrobe for all my editions to enhance convenience, enabling me to better organize, consolidate, and manage my work effectively.
 Just like the cuckoo bird lays its eggs in the nests of other birds, the Eggs project introduces a similar concept in the form of a self-configuring PXE service. This service allows you to boot and install your ISO on networked computers that are not originally configured for your specific ISO.
 Krill adopts a TUI interface that closely resembles Calamares, ensuring a consistent user experience. Leveraging the same configuration files created by Eggs for Calamares, Krill maintains compatibility and allows for seamless transitions between desktop and server installations. By simply adding the flag during installation, Krill enables unattended installations, streamlining the process for system administrators. Fine-tuning installation parameters becomes effortless as the configuration values can be modified in the ```/etc/penguins-eggs.d/krill.yaml``` file, facilitating automated deployments.
 man pages serve as documentation for the installed packages, providing detailed information on their usage, configuration options, and other relevant details. The inclusion of man pages ensures that users have access to comprehensive documentation, enabling them to effectively utilize and manage the Eggs packages.
 Once the package has been installed, you can have the new ```eggs``` command. Typing ```eggs``` will get the list of commands, and typing ```eggs produce --help``` will get the eggs produce command help screen. You can also use the command autocomplete with the TABS key, you will get the possible choices for each command. In addition, there is a man page, so by typing ```man eggs``` you will get that help as well. You can also use the ```eggs mom``` command that interactively allows you to consult the help for all commands and online documentation.
 One of the key advantages of Penguins-eggs is its commitment to utilizing only the original distro's packages. This means that no modifications are made to your repository lists, ensuring a safe and reliable environment. Penguins-eggs prioritizes maintaining the integrity and authenticity of your Linux distribution.
 One of the standout features of Penguins Eggs' is its hassle-free setup. It comes with all the necessary configurations, making it a convenient choice for users. Just like in real life, the magic of Penguins Eggs' lies within - no additional setup required! 
 Penguins-eggs has got you covered. To get started with Penguins-eggs, you'll need to install it on your Linux distribution. The tool supports a wide range of Linux distributions and their major derivatives, including Arch, Debian, Devuan, Manjaro, Ubuntu, and more. Additionally, you can easily add support for additional derivatives, expanding the tool's capabilities even further.
 Penguins-eggs is a versatile tool that offers an array of features and benefits for Linux users. Whether you want to create an installable ISO from your current Linux system or explore various customization options,
 Penguins-eggs provides various options to suit your needs. With the --clone flag, you can preserve the data and accounts of unencrypted users, ensuring a seamless experience for users accessing the live system. Moreover, you can opt for a crypted clone, where user data and accounts are saved in an encrypted LUKS volume within the ISO image, enhancing security and privacy.
 Safe: only use the original distro's packages, without any modification in your repository lists. Penguins Eggs Linux embarks on a steadfast commitment to user security and system integrity through its default practice of exclusively utilizing original distributions’ packages without any modifications in the repository lists. This resolute dedication to maintaining the pristine authenticity of packages reinforces Penguins Eggs’ fundamental ethos of safety and reliability, fostering an environment characterized by unwavering trust in the integrity of the software ecosystem.
 Starting from version 9.4.3, penguins-eggs is now included in the Manjaro community repository, making it even easier to install on Manjaro Linux. To install penguins-eggs on Manjaro, you can use the `pamac` package manager with the following command:
 sudo ./get-eggs.sh
 There are multiple methods available, lately I prefer `get-eggs` way, working for all the supported distros: Arch, Debian, Devuan, Manjaro, Ubuntu and derivatives.:
 To enhance customization options, Penguins-eggs introduces the concept of Wardrobe. With Wardrobe and its various components, such as costumes, you can easily organize and manage your customizations, samples, and more. This feature enables a streamlined and efficient workflow, allowing you to tailor your Linux system to your preferences.
 To install Eggs, the simplest method is to download the package `penguins-eggs` from the project's SourceForge page  [package eggs](https://penguins-eggs.net/basket/index.php?p=packages%2Fdebs) and install it on your system.
 To install penguins-eggs on Arch Linux, there are multiple methods available. One option is to install it directly from the Arch User Repository (AUR) by adding the `chaotic-AUR` repository. Here's how you can do it:
 To simplify the installation process, Penguins-eggs provides its own system installer called krill. This installer is particularly useful when a GUI (Graphical User Interface) is not available, allowing for installation in various situations. However, if you are using a desktop system, Penguins-eggs recommends and configures the calamares GUI installer, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.
 Yolk is a local repository that is bundled within the LiveCD of Eggs. This repository contains a carefully curated selection of essential packages required for installation. Yolk serves as a valuable resource, as it allows you to install your system confidently, even without an active internet connection.

* Creating Custom Live ISOs: It lets you generate a bootable live ISO from your system. You can share this ISO with others or use it to boot your setup on different hardware. It’s like creating your own personalized Linux distro without starting from scratch.
* Distribution Remastering: If you’re into crafting your own Linux distro (or a spin of an existing one), `penguins-eggs` simplifies the process. You can tweak an existing system, strip out or add components, and then package it as a new ISO for distribution.
* System Backup and Cloning: You can use penguins-eggs to create a snapshot of your current Linux system, including installed packages, configurations, and user data (if you choose). This can be handy for disaster recovery or migrating to a new machine.
* The eggs icon was designed by [Charlie Martinez](https://github.com/quirinux-so);
* This README would not be so well cared for if not for the work of [Hosein Seilain](https://github.com/hosseinseilani) who spent his time revising and supplementing the text;
**penguins-eggs** is a system cloning and distribution remastering tool primarily designed for Linux distributions.

•	`eggs produce --clone`: All user data is included unencrypted directly in the live system.
•	`eggs produce --cryptedclone`: All user data is included encrypted within a LUKS volume inside the ISO.
•	`eggs produce` (default): All private data is removed from the live system.
•	On the other hand, the `eggs produce --cryptedclone` command saves the data within the generated ISO using a LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) volume. With this option, the user data will not be visible in the live system. However, it can be automatically reinstalled during the system installation process using the "krill" installer. Even if someone has the generated ISO, they won't be able to access the user data without the LUKS passphrase. This ensures that your data remains protected.
•	The `eggs produce --clone` command allows you to save both user data and system data directly in the generated ISO. This means that if someone obtains a copy of the ISO, they will be able to see and access the 
•	The default mode, achieved by using the command `eggs produce`, completely removes user data from the live distribution. This ensures that no private data remains in the live system.

`get-eggs` on Debian families add automatically the `penguins-eggs-ppa` repository and, when need, add `nodesource` repository. On Arch, `chaotic-aur` repo will be added.
`penguins-eggs-25.7.x` depends on `nodejs >18`, which is not directly available on all distros. We can rely on [nodesource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions?tab=readme-ov-file#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions) for adding them.

`penguins-eggs` is the package name of `eggs` a console tool, under continuous development, that allows you to remaster your system and redistribute it as live images on USB sticks or via PXE. 
`yay` will handle the installation process for you, including any necessary dependencies.

>    During the installation process, you can use the "krill" installer to restore your crypted data automatically. By running the command "sudo eggs install" with the "krill" installer, your encrypted data will be securely transferred and made available in the installed system.
>   `eggs` is an actively developed console tool designed to help you customize and distribute your system as live images on USB sticks or through PXE. By using this tool, you can remaster your system according to your preferences.
>   By following these instructions, you can upgrade Eggs either through the penguins-eggs-ppa repository or by manually downloading and installing the latest version from the SourceForge page. Ensure that you choose the appropriate method based on your current setup to keep Eggs up to date with the latest enhancements and bug fixes.
>  By default, `eggs` completely removes the system's data and users. However, it also offers the option to remaster the system while including the data and accounts of existing users. This can be done using the `--clone` flag. Additionally, you can preserve the users and files by storing them in an encrypted LUKS file within the resulting ISO file, which can be achieved with the `--cryptedclone` flag.
>  By leveraging the cuckoo command, the Eggs project provides a convenient method for deploying and testing your ISO on a variety of networked computers, expanding the possibilities for system installations and evaluations.
>  Furthermore, my participation in the Manjaro Community Repository demonstrates my commitment to providing support for Eggs on the Manjaro distribution. Manjaro is a popular Arch-based Linux distribution known for its user-friendly approach and community-driven development. By actively contributing to the Manjaro Community Repository, I can ensure that Eggs remains compatible and well-integrated with the Manjaro ecosystem.
>  In summary, Eggs is available in the AUR and is directly maintained by me. Additionally, I am actively involved in the Manjaro Community Repository to provide support for Eggs on the Manjaro distribution. This ensures that users of Arch Linux and its derivatives, such as Manjaro, can easily access and benefit from using Eggs in their systems.
>  One interesting feature of `eggs` is its integration with the `penguins-wardrobe` This allows you to create or utilize scripts to switch between different configurations. For example, you can start with a bare version of the system, featuring only a command-line interface (CLI), and then easily transition to a full graphical user interface (GUI) or server configurations.
>  The resulting live system can be easily installed using either the calamares installer or the internal TUI krill installer. Furthermore, using `krill`, you can easily get an unattended installation, utilizing `--unattended` and various [krill](#eggs-krill) flags.
>  This command will apply differents compression to the ISO file, resulting in a smaller file size or in a longer process. Consult [Penguins Eggs' official guide](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/eggs-users-guide) for more detailed informations.

By adapting to the packaging systems used by different distributions, Eggs ensures compatibility and ease of use across a wide range of Linux environments. Whether you're using Debian, Devuan, Ubuntu, Arch, or ManjaroLinux, Eggs is equipped to support your preferred distribution, enabling you to make the most of its features and functionalities.
By default, penguins-eggs uses fasted compression `zstd level 3` for efficiency during the creation process. However, if you want a more compressed ISO file, you can chooce `--pendrive` flag `zstd level 15` optimized for pendrives, `--standard` flag, use  `xz`, or `--max` flag using `xz -Xbcj` to get the maximun level of compression. For example:
By following these steps, you can easily install Eggs, add the penguins-eggs-ppa repository, [penguins-eggs-ppa](https://pieroproietti.github.io/penguins-eggs-ppa), and unlock further capabilities and enhancements for your Eggs installation.
By including Yolk in the LiveCD, Eggs ensures that all the necessary packages are readily available during the installation process. This eliminates the dependency on an internet connection, making it possible to install your system in offline environments or situations where internet access is limited or unavailable.
By providing deb packages for various architectures, Eggs promotes accessibility and inclusivity, allowing users on different hardware platforms to benefit from its functionality. Whether you're using a traditional desktop computer or an ARM-based device, Eggs ensures compatibility and a consistent experience across the Debian family of distributions.

Considered a work-in-progress, the ultimate goal of Penguins Eggs is to allow the creation of live ISOs from an installed system and their use for system installations.  It can be used both to create images on USB devices - even [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) - and as a PXE server to distribute the image itself over a local network. Inspired by the behavior of the cuckoo bird, which depends on others to hatch its eggs.

From the release of version 9.6.x, Penguins’ Eggs is available as a [Debian package](https://penguins-eggs.net/basket/index.php?p=packages%2Fdebs), then was extended to Arch Linux creating the relative [PKGBUILD](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/penguins-eggs). Nowadays, eggs can remaster AlmaLinux, Fedora, openmamba, openSuSE, and  RockyLinux too.
Furthermore, addons, predominantly themes, have been organized under the vendor's folder in the penguin's wardrobe. I encourage utilizing your wardrobe for all your customization needs to maintain consistency and organization throughout your work.

Here are some examples of how to use penguins-eggs to create live systems with different configurations:
Here’s a breakdown of what it’s used for:
I created and maintain a package for Alpine. Its repository is [penguins-alpine](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-alpine) and related packages can be downloaded from  [penguins-eggs.net](https://penguins-eggs.net/basket/index.php/packages/alpine) or the [sourceforge page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/files/Packages/alpine/).
I have high hopes that people will take an interest in wardrobe and consider forking the main repository to incorporate their own customizations. By collaborating, we can achieve significant progress that would be challenging for a single developer to accomplish. If you would like to delve deeper into the wardrobe, I recommend reading the [Penguins Eggs' blog](https://penguins-eggs.net/blog/wardrobe-colibri-duck-eagle-and-owl/). post titled Wardrobe: Colibri, Duck, Eagle, and Owl, which provides further insights into its features and benefits.
I like it, I hope you like it too, and I thank Jorge for his daring. 
If you have already added the penguins-eggs-ppa repository, you can upgrade Eggs alongside other packages on your system by running the following command:

If you prefer to build from source, you can download the sources from the AUR repository. Here are the steps:
In addition to the official guide, there are other resources available for Penguins Eggs' users, particularly developers. These resources can be found in the [penguins-eggs repository](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs) under the [documents](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs/tree/master/documents) section.
In addition to the scripts, `penguins-eggs` package also include man pages, bash-completion and other.
informations about eggs status
Initially built with javascript and then switched to Typescript as the main development language, the design of the tool resembles an egg production process, consisting of operations such as produce to create the eggs and hatch to install them (I changed a bit later: from hatch to install, then to krill as a tribute to calamares tribes).
It also caters to different architectures, namely `amd64`, `i386`, and `arm64`.
It took years of work to create the penguins-eggs, and I also incurred expenses for renting the site and subscribing to Google Gemini, for the artificial intelligence that is now indispensable.
It’s often used to create customized live ISO images or backups of a Linux system, allowing users to replicate or share their setup easily. Think of it as a way to "hatch" a new system from an existing one—hence the funny name.
It's possible too to use the popular AUR helper tool called `yay`. Simply run the following command:
It's the most pratical way and is suitable for all [supported distros](https://github.com/pieroproietti/get-eggs/blob/main/SUPPORTED-DISTROS.md).

The availability of `penguins-eggs` as a deb package simplifies the installation process for users of Debian-based distributions. Whether you are running a 64-bit (amd64) or 32-bit (i386) architecture, or even an arm64 architecture, Eggs has you covered. This ensures that users across a wide range of Debian-based systems can easily download, install, and utilize Eggs' features.
The concept behind Penguins’ Eggs stems from the idea of “reproduction” and “population selection” applied to operating systems. During the era of popular remastering programs like Remastersys and Systemback, both of which experienced maintenance issues and were eventually abandoned, the need for a new, modern tool became evident. 
The inspiration for Penguins’ Eggs led to the development of a new tool written in a modern, cross-distribution language, utilizing its own packaging system. 
The packages `penguins-eggs` provided include standard scripts for `preinst`, `postinst`, `prerm`, and `postrm`. These scripts play a crucial role in the installation and management of the packages. The preinst script is executed before the package is installed, allowing for any necessary preparations or configurations. The postinst script is executed after the package installation, enabling additional setup or customization. Similarly, the prerm script is executed before the package is removed, while the postrm script is executed after the package removal.
The packages can be installed on Debian, Devuan, or Ubuntu-based distributions without the need to worry about the specific version. Whether you're using Buster, Bullseye, Bookworm, Trixie, Chimaera, Daedalus, Focal, Jammy or Noble, `eggs` is reported to work across these versions. However, it's important to ensure compatibility with the respective processor architecture.

When creating a live distribution of your system, you have different options to consider: the default mode, clone, and cryptedclone.
With the command `cuckoo` you can deploy a newly created ISO on an already installed system, or you can live to boot the ISO itself. This means that you can either install your ISO on existing systems or directly run the ISO without the need for a permanent installation.
