# OpenSuSE
# Mount filesystems in the target (generally, before treating the
# target as a usable chroot / "live" system). Filesystems are
# automatically mounted from the partitioning module. Filesystems
# listed here are **extra**. The filesystems listed in *extraMounts*
# are mounted in all target systems. The filesystems listed in
# *extraMountsEfi* are mounted in the target system **only** if
# the host machine uses UEFI.

#   - fs        The filesystem type to use
#   - mountPoint Where to mount the filesystem
#   - options (optional) Extra options to pass to mount(8)
