# This is a dynamic resolv.conf file for connecting local clients to the
# internal DNS stub resolver of systemd-resolved. This file lists all

# Run "resolvectl status" to see details about the uplink DNS servers

# Third party programs should typically not access this file directly, but only

# different way, replace this symlink by a static file or a different symlink.
