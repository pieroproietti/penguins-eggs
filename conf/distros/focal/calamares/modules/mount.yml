# Mount filesystems in the target (generally, before treating the
# target as a usable chroot / "live" system). Filesystems are
# automatically mounted from the partitioning module. Filesystems
# listed here are **extra**. The filesystems listed in *extraMounts*
# are mounted in all target systems. The filesystems listed in
# *extraMountsEfi* are mounted in the target system **only** if
# the host machine uses UEFI.
