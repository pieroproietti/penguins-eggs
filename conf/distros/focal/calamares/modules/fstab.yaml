# If a filesystem is on an SSD, add the following options. If a specific
# filesystem is listed here, use those options, otherwise no additional
# options are set (i.e. there is no *default* like in *mountOptions*).
#
# This example configuration applies the *discard* option to most
# common filesystems on an SSD. This may not be the right option
# for your distribution. If you use a systemd timer to trim the
# SSD, it may interfere with the *discard* option. Opinions vary
# as to whether *discard* is worth the effort -- it depends on
# the usage pattern of the disk as well.

#
# The standard configuration applies asynchronous discard support and ssd optimizations to btrfs
# and does nothing for other filesystems.

# Options for handling /tmp in /etc/fstab
# Currently default (required) and ssd are supported
# The corresponding string can contain the following variables:
# tmpfs: true or tmpfs: false to either mount /tmp as tmpfs or not
# options: "<mount options>"

# Example:
#tmpOptions:
#    default:
#        tmpfs: false
#        options: ""
#    ssd:
#        tmpfs: true
