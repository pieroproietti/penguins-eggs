# NAKED Ubuntu

We start with `ubuntu-24.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso` our `prerequisites.sh` is the same as for Debian, plus we remove two packages for server: cloud-init and needrestart.

All you must to do is run `sudo ./penguins-eggs/PREREQUISITES/ubuntu/install.sh` then `./penguins-eggs/install-eggs-dev.sh`.
