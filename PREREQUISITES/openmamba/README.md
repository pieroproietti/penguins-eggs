# OpenMamba

I used `openmamba-livecd-light-it-snapshot-20241023.x86_64.iso` installation.

After completed installation, just reboot, clone penguins-eggs,

`cd penguins-eggs/PREREQUISITES/openmamba`

`sudo ./PREREQUISITES/install.sh`

then after finish, con in the main folder `~/penguins-eggs` and run `./install-eggs-dev.sh`.

That's all!

You can start producing your iso with: `eggs love` or dress it like a colibri using `eggs wardrobe get` and `sudo eggs wardrobe wear colibri
